On the ninth day of Christmas...

... we added another geom_ layer to our graphic.

Here's our geom_lin() graphic from yesterday:
```{r}
trees %>%
ggplot(aes(x=height, y=xmas.magic, group=type))+
  geom_line(aes(colour=type), linetype="dashed")
```

Now let's add points to it as well. It's as simple as + geom_point()!
```{r}
trees %>%
ggplot(aes(x=height, y=xmas.magic, group=type))+
  geom_line(aes(colour=type), linetype="dashed")+
  geom_point()
```

And if you want to change the aesthetics of those points, where do you do it? Within geom_point()!
```{r}
trees %>%
ggplot(aes(x=height, y=xmas.magic, group=type))+
  geom_line(aes(colour=type), linetype="dashed")+
  geom_point(aes(colour=type), size = 3, shape = 8)
```

They kind of look like Christmas lights :)
